The CITRIS Invention Lab supports faculty, student and community innovation by providing the knowledge, tools and support to rapidly design and prototype novel interactive products, embedded sensing systems and integrated mobile devices. This facility is a vital piece of the CITRIS pipeline running from the minds of researchers through CITRIS laboratories, and into the markets, industries, and streets of the world.

The Invention Lab offers a variety of prototyping equipment ranging from basic craft tools to electronics workbenches, CAD stations and professional digital fabrication machines.  Common prototyping materials and supplies are available for purchase in the lab. Lab staff provides additional guidance and support for design and equipment use. Together, these assets have already helped students turn ideas such as cloud-based car diagnostic devices, smart hydration tracking cups and phone-controlled irrigation systems into functional prototypes
